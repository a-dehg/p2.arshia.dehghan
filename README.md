Very Basic Mirror Sketch!

I was going for a design that wouldn't obstruct the main use of a mirror, to let the user see themselves. So I wanted all the widgets and gadgets to be off to the side/off to the corner.
I had no webcam, so I represented the user in an abstract manner via a face for their head, and many circles for their hand that is near the mirror.


This mirror has a few things going for it. It keeps track of the time you've spent using the mirror, has time and date recording, a calender, a newsfeed, weather report, text notifications, social media interactions, and a settings widget that lets you change the light/coloration of the entire mirror to three other colors.
